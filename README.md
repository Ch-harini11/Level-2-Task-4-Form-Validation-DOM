## 📋 How It Works

- Navigate using `Home` and `Register` links (client-side routing).
- In the register form:
  - Username must be at least 3 characters.
  - Email must be in a valid format.
  - Password must be strong (length ≥ 6, includes uppercase + number).
- Password strength updates as you type.
- DOM updates without refreshing the page.
